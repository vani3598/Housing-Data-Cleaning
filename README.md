This data analysis project focuses on the "Housing Nashville" dataset, which contains information related to housing in the Nashville area. The dataset was acquired and cleaned using SQL, resulting in a well-structured and reliable dataset for analysis.

Data Cleaning Process:
The following data cleaning steps were undertaken using SQL:

1. Data Import: The dataset was imported into a SQL database for analysis.
2. Handling Missing Values: Missing values in various columns were identified and dealt with appropriately. This involved imputation, removal, or, when necessary, manual entry of missing data.
3. Data Type Conversion: Ensuring that data types for each column were consistent and appropriate for analysis. This included converting date fields to datetime objects and numeric columns to appropriate data types.
4. Duplicates Removal: Duplicate records were identified and removed to maintain data integrity.
5. Data Normalization: Inconsistent formatting of data, such as text fields, was standardized to ensure consistency.
6. Outlier Detection: Outliers in numeric data were detected and analyzed for potential data anomalies or entry errors.
